# Overview
Aerohub is a website built for the popular Roblox game, [Aeronautica](https://www.roblox.com/games/6647962258/Aeronautica).

During my time in the Aeronautica community, I noticed that many people enjoyed creating and sharing liveries, but it was hard to search for the ones you like.
Aerohub is my attempt in solving that problem.

Aerohub allows players to sign in through their Discord accounts, making it easily accessible for the 30,000+ member discord community.
Signed in users can upload liveries with relevant meta data, and other users can search, filter, and browse through all uploaded liveries.
